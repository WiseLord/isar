Description: normal world user space client APIs for OP-TEE (development)
 OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a
 non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone
 technology. OP-TEE implements TEE Internal Core API v1.1.x which is the API
 exposed to Trusted Applications and the TEE Client API v1.0, which is the
 API describing how to communicate with a TEE. This package provides the TEE
 Client API library.
 .
 This package contains the development files OpTEE Client API
